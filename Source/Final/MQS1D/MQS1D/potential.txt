INFORMATION
In this program the potential function MUST be a continuous function in the
interval I of definition, in the variable x.
It must be written using the Matlab syntax and using the dots in operations
(ex. x.^2, exp(x).*x./sin(x)).

INTERESTING POTENTIALS EXAMPLE:
1 Harmonic Oscillator (DEFAULT POTENTIAL)
By default the program starts with the harmonic oscillator so it use:

V(x) = x^2/2

The solution to this problem is know exactly and the binding states are 
described by the formula
E(n) = n + 1/2
Using the AEA MODE the program shows the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions.

2 V(x) = cos(x).*x.^2/5+1; I = [-8 8]; x0 = 3
3 V(x) = x.^2/5+0.01*x.^4; I = [-8 8]; x0 = 1
4 V(x) = x.^2/5+3*exp(-(x/2).^2)-4/5*(1+log(15/4)); I = [-10 10]; x0 = 2 ( Tunnel Effect )

5 Poschl-Teller Potential
This potential is useful to illustrate the AEA Mode, in fact the 
Poschl-Teller potential is a 1D potential and is formula is:

V(x, k) = - k(k+1)/2 * (sech(x))^2

Where k is a natural number, the Shrodinger equation with this potential
can be solved analytically, in particular the binding states are:
E(n) = -n^2/2 with n = 1,2,...,k
And the corresponding eigenfunctions are the Legendre functions L(n,k,tgh(x)).
So the potential to write in the program is:

V(x) = -0.5*k*(k+1)*(sech(x)).^2

Example:
k = 5
V(x) = -0.5*5*(5+1)*(sech(x)).^2
I = [-5 5]
